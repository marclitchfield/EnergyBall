At this time only OSX 10.8/Windows 7 has been tested.\n\nAdd Sphero to your app:\n\n```javascript\nvar roundRobot = require('node-sphero');\nvar sphero = new roundRobot.Sphero();\n\nsphero.on('connected', function(ball) {\n  ball.setRGBLED(0, 255, 0, false);\n});\n\nsphero.connect();\n```\n\nRun that and your sphero should turn #00FF00... green.\n\nCheck out the examples for more ideas.\n\n## OS X\n\nYou will need Node.js 8.x and the build tool provided by xcode. The Command Line tools for xcode can be downloaded from Apple's [developer site](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action) for free. \n\nYou can install NodeJS for by downloading it from [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org)\n\n\n## Windows\n\nYou will need node.js 8.x (32-bit only), (node-gyp(included with node) / Python 2.x / and the build tools provided by Visual Studio 2010)\n\nYou must use the 32bit version of nodejs, because there are issues with the serialport builds on the x64 platform.\nYou can install NodeJS by downloading it from [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org/download/) Current 32bit version is available here: [http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.8.9/node-v0.8.9-x86.msi](http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.8.9/node-v0.8.9-x86.msi)\n\nPython. Remember you want the latest 2.x release: [python windows binaries](http://www.python.org/download/releases/)\n\nIf you dont have visual studio 2010, you can download the [express edition](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads#d-2010-express) for free. You'll want the c++ version, or the all in one.\n\nIf have a of Visual Studio OTHER THAN 2010, you might run into some issues. Please read [this](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp/issues/44)\n\n## In Progress\n\nThe rest of the sphero bluetooth api functionality.\n\n## Thanks \n\nAwesome work by [Bradley Meck](https://github.com/bmeck) who built the initial version.\n",
